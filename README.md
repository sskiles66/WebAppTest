# Overview

I developed a simple web app that uses Node JS for a web server. The server can be started by going inside of the testdynamicpages folder in the terminal and typing npm start. The page will be available on localhost:3000.

I wrote this software so that I could begin my learning of backend development of websites.

# Web Pages

The first page is a login page where a user can enter in their username and password and once they submit that informatio, the user will be redirected to a user page where the page will welcome the user via their username. On that same page, user can add courses to a list and see those courses.

# Development Environment



I used VSCode and I had to install a few things like Node JS, Express, EJS, etc.



# Useful Websites

# Future Work

In the future, I need to find resources that apply more specifically to what I am trying to achieve. I learned some of the basics for Node JS but I wasn't able to find many resources on dynamic web pages.
